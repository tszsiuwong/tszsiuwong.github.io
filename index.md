I am a PhD student at Peking University. My research is strongly correlated electrons systems, like superconductivity and charge density wave instability.

I use the ultrashort laser pulses to detect the decaying dynamic of quantum materials after excitation. Ultrashort laser pulses can also trigger a coherent oscillation of collective mode, which is now widely used for characterizing phase transitions.

#### The dynamics of Kagome metal probed by femtosecond laser pulses

With time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy, we show that the excited quasiparticle relaxation dynamics can be explained by the formation of a temperature-dependent energy gap below the phase transition that is similar to a usual second-order charge density wave (CDW) condensate. By contrast, the structural change shows a predominantly first-order phase transition. Furthermore, no CDW amplitude mode is identified in the ordered phase. The results suggest that the CDW order is very different from a conventional CDW condensate. We also find that a weak pump pulse can nonthermally melt the CDW order and drive the sample into its high-temperature phase, revealing a small difference in lattice potential between those phases.

#### The collective excitation mode in superconductors, the Higgs mode

Two methods to detect the Higgs mode are introduced: THz-pump THz-probe and strong-field THz wave nonlinear optical response. Besides the expected third harmonic generation (THG), a new transient oscillation is observed, which softens in frequency with temperature increasing towards superconducting transition temperature. We identified it as the Higgs transient oscillation. We introduce a time-frequency resolved technique, named spectrogram for visualizing THz spectrum. The dynamic decaying behavior of the oscillation is observed, which is consistent with theoretical expectation about intrinsic Higgs oscillation. Moreover, we observe a higher order nonlinear optics effect, i.e. fifth harmonic generation, which we assign to the higher order coupling between Higgs mode and electromagnetic field.
