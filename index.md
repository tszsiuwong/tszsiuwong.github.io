I am a PhD student at Peking University. My research area is mainly about agricultural economics and development economics.

Currently, my research aims to explore rural women's bargaining power within households and its impacts on widespread household outcomes, especially intergenerational effects.

#### Memory of famine: The persistent impact of famine experience on food waste behavior

The 1959–1961 Great Famine in China was one of the most devastating events in history and had long-term effects on economic behavior. This paper seeks to provide a novel explanation for heterogeneous food waste behaviors across age cohorts from the perspective of differing famine experiences. Based on 2004–2009 China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data, this paper constructs a difference-in-difference estimator to explore the long-term effects of the early-life famine experience of the household head on household food waste behavior in later life. The results indicate that the more serious famine that the household heads experienced in early life was, the less wasted food and lost calories per capita there were, especially for adolescence during the famine. The mechanism analysis shows that households whose heads experienced the 1959–1961 Great Famine in early life tend to save more than those whose heads did not. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the formation of preference and the variation in household food waste behaviors across age cohorts.

#### Does rubber expansion hinder the migration of rural labor? Evidence from southwest China

The expansion of agroforestry crops in South Asia has resulted in the reallocation of local agricultural resources, including labor force. Based on two-wave panel data collected from more than 600 smallholder rubber farmers in southwest China, this study examines the impacts of rubber expansion on the migration of rural labor. The results show that smallholders planting more rubber plantations have significantly fewer migrant family members and lower likelihood of migration, revealing a significantly negative effect of rubber cultivation on the migration of rural labor. Given that the migration of rural labor is a major trend in rural economic transformation, rubber farming appears to result in the resource curse in rubber planting areas. In addition, a positive interaction effect between rubber cultivation and the price of natural rubber on the migration of rural labor reveals that the resource curse effect of natural rubber decreases with the decrease in the price of natural rubber. A period with a relatively low price of natural rubber provides an opportunity to foster the migration of rural labor in rubber planting areas.

I am a PhD student at Peking University. My research is strongly correlated electrons systems, like superconductivity and charge density wave instability.

I use the ultrashort laser pulses to detect the decaying dynamic of quantum materials after excitation. Ultrashort laser pulses can also trigger a coherent oscillation of collective mode, which is now widely used for characterizing phase transitions.

#### The dynamics of Kagome metal probed by femtosecond laser pulses

With time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy, we show that the excited quasiparticle relaxation dynamics can be explained by the formation of a temperature-dependent energy gap below the phase transition that is similar to a usual second-order charge density wave (CDW) condensate. By contrast, the structural change shows a predominantly first-order phase transition. Furthermore, no CDW amplitude mode is identified in the ordered phase. The results suggest that the CDW order is very different from a conventional CDW condensate. We also find that a weak pump pulse can nonthermally melt the CDW order and drive the sample into its high-temperature phase, revealing a small difference in lattice potential between those phases.

#### The collective excitation mode in superconductors, the Higgs mode

Besides the expected third harmonic generation (THG), a new transient oscillation is observed, which softens in frequency with temperature increasing towards superconducting transition temperature. We identified it as the Higgs transient oscillation. We introduce a time-frequency resolved technique, named spectrogram for visualizing THz spectrum. The dynamic decaying behavior of the oscillation is observed, which is consistent with theoretical expectation about intrinsic Higgs oscillation. Moreover, we observe a higher order nonlinear optics effect, i.e. fifth harmonic generation, which we assign to the higher order coupling between Higgs mode and electromagnetic field.
